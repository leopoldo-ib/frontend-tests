# Use Markdown Any Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record any decisions made in this project independently, whether decisions concern the architecture ("architectural decision record"), the code, or other fields.
Which format and structure should these records follow?

## Considered Options

- [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)
- Any other template listed [here](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/a3497ad745f346d20ad5b7108fd46d9658db074f).

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **MADR**, because its format is lean and easy to maintain.
